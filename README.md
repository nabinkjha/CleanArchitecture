# Clean Architecture Boilerplate - ASP.NET Core 5.0 (WebApi & MVC)
Clean Architecture Solution Template for ASP.NET Core 5.0. Built with Onion/Hexagonal Architecture and incorporates the most essential Packages your projects will ever need. Includes both WebApi and Web(MVC) Projects.


# The Vision

An idea to bring together the best and essential practices / pacakges of ASP.NET Core 5.0 along with Clean Hexagonal Architecture that can be a right fit for small/mid and enterprise level solutions.
How easy would it be if you are able to run a single line of CLI command on your Console and you get a complete implementation in no time? That's the exact vision I have while building this full fledged Boilerplate template.

## Technologies Used

- ASP.NET Core 5.0 WebAPI
- ASP.NET Core 5.0 MVC
- Entity Framework Core 5.0

## Contributions / Help Needed

It would be great if a few of you could contribute to this project. Here are the points I would love to have some help with.

- Someone to fix typos on this Readme, or prepare a better one. 
- Someone to add Localizers throughout the MVC Project.
- Someone to add Arabic Transalations throughout the MVC Project. You can find the Dictionary under the Resources Folder in the Web Project.
